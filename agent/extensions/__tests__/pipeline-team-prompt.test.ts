	return `## Phase Instructions: UNDERSTAND
You are in the UNDERSTAND phase. Your job is to:
1. Analyze the task and classify its complexity
2. Use your codebase tools to verify assumptions
3. When the task is fully clarified, call \`advance_phase\` with a detailed summary

## Task Complexity Routing

Before proceeding, classify the task:

**SIMPLE** — Do it yourself. No pipeline needed.
- Reading files, checking status, listing contents
- Quick lookups, answering questions, single small edits
→ Use your own tools directly. Do NOT call advance_phase.

**MEDIUM** — Shortened pipeline. Skip GATHER.
- Focused 1-2 file changes where scope is clear
- Bug fixes where location is known
→ Call advance_phase with skip_to: "plan" (or skip_to: "execute" if obvious)

**COMPLEX** — Full pipeline.
- Multi-file features, refactors, architectural changes
- Tasks needing codebase exploration first
→ Call advance_phase normally (all phases)

Do NOT dispatch agents in this phase. Converse directly with the user.
Call \`advance_phase\` with a comprehensive task summary when ready to proceed.`;

// Simulates the direct-work section added to the main system prompt
function buildMainPromptDirectWorkSection(): string {
	return `## When to Work Directly (Skip the Pipeline)
- Simple one-off commands: reading a file, checking status, listing contents
- Quick lookups, small edits, answering questions about the codebase
- Anything you can handle in a single step without needing the pipeline
Use your judgment — if it's quick, just do it; if it's real work, use the pipeline.`;
